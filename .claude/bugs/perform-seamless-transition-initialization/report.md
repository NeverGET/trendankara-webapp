# Bug Report

## Bug Summary
React Hook `useEffect` references `performSeamlessTransition` before it's initialized, causing a ReferenceError during component render.

## Bug Details

### Expected Behavior
The RadioPlayerContext should initialize properly without any reference errors, allowing the radio player to function correctly with seamless stream URL transitions.

### Actual Behavior
The application crashes with a ReferenceError stating "Cannot access 'performSeamlessTransition' before initialization" when the RadioPlayerProvider component is rendered.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the public-facing pages of the application
2. The RadioPlayerProvider component is loaded as part of the PublicLayout
3. The useEffect hook on line 359 attempts to reference performSeamlessTransition
4. ReferenceError occurs immediately during component initialization

### Environment
- **Version**: Next.js 15.5.3 with Webpack
- **Platform**: Web browser (any)
- **Configuration**: Production/Development React application

## Impact Assessment

### Severity
- [x] Critical - System unusable
- [ ] High - Major functionality broken
- [ ] Medium - Feature impaired but workaround exists
- [ ] Low - Minor issue or cosmetic

### Affected Users
All users accessing the public-facing website - the radio player is completely non-functional.

### Affected Features
- Radio player functionality
- Stream URL transitions
- Fallback URL handling
- Overall public site layout

## Additional Context

### Error Messages

```

### Screenshots/Media
N/A - Runtime error prevents page rendering

### Related Issues
None identified

## Initial Analysis

### Suspected Root Cause
The `performSeamlessTransition` function is defined with `useCallback` on line 362, but it's being referenced in the dependency array of a `useEffect` hook on line 359 that appears before its definition in the code. JavaScript hoisting doesn't work with `const` declarations, causing the reference error.

### Affected Components
- **File**: `src/components/radio/RadioPlayerContext.tsx`
  - Lines 259-359: useEffect hook with problematic dependency
  - Lines 362-415: performSeamlessTransition definition
- **File**: `src/app/(public)/layout.tsx`
  - Line 15: RadioPlayerProvider usage
