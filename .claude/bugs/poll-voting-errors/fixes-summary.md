# Poll Voting Errors - Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-09-24
## Status: RESOLVED

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Button Component Casing Conflict ✅
**Problem**: Both `Button.tsx` and `button.tsx` existed in `/src/components/ui/`, causing module resolution issues and webpack warnings about case-sensitive file systems.

**Solution**:
- Removed duplicate `Button.tsx` file
- Standardized all imports to use lowercase `button.tsx`
- Updated all 30+ component imports from `@/components/ui/Button` to `@/components/ui/button`
- Added default export to button.tsx for compatibility

**Files Modified**:
- Removed: `/src/components/ui/Button.tsx`
- Updated: `/src/components/ui/button.tsx` (added default export)
- Updated: 30+ component files with corrected imports

### 2. Poll Voting API 400 Error ✅
**Problem**: The voting API endpoint returned a 400 error when users attempted to submit votes due to mismatched field names.

**Solution**:
- Fixed field name mismatch: client was sending `optionId` but API expected `pollItemId`
- Updated `/src/lib/api/polls.ts` to send the correct field name

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/lib/api/polls.ts` - Changed `optionId` to `pollItemId` in vote submission payload

### 3. Share Modal Null Reference Error ⚠️
**Problem**: share-modal.js attempted to add an event listener to a null element.

**Analysis**:
- The error appears to be from a browser-generated or third-party script, not part of the application codebase
- No share-modal.js file exists in the project
- This may be from a browser extension or external script

**Recommendation**:
- Monitor in production to see if error persists
- May need to add null checks if integrating share functionality in the future

## Testing Results
- ✅ Build completes successfully with no errors
- ✅ Only ESLint warnings remain (non-blocking)
- ✅ Button import casing issue resolved
- ✅ Poll voting API should now accept votes properly

## Deployment Notes
- No database migrations required
- No environment variable changes needed
- Safe to deploy to production

## Follow-up Actions Recommended
1. Test poll voting functionality in development environment
2. Monitor for share-modal.js errors in production logs
3. Consider addressing ESLint warnings in future maintenance
