4. Build terminates with exit code 1

  399 |                   isBreaking={article.isBreaking}
```

### Screenshots/Media
N/A - Terminal build output error

### Related Issues
- TypeScript configuration was recently updated (strictNullChecks was set to true)
- Project appears to use 'thumbnail' as the correct property name for article images

## Initial Analysis

### Suspected Root Cause
The code is attempting to access a property `featured_image` that doesn't exist in the NewsArticle type definition. The correct property appears to be `thumbnail` based on the existing code structure.

### Affected Components
- `/src/app/admin/news/page.tsx` (line 396)
- NewsArticle type definition
- NewsCard component props
