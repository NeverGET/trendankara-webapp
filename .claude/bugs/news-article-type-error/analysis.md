# Bug Analysis

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Summary
The build error occurs because the code references a non-existent property `featured_image` on the NewsArticle type, while the correct property name is `thumbnail`.

### Root Cause
Type mismatch - attempting to access undefined property on NewsArticle interface

### Contributing Factors
- Recent TypeScript strictNullChecks enablement exposed this previously hidden issue
- Inconsistent property naming between different parts of the codebase

## Technical Details

### Affected Code Locations
- **File**: `src/app/admin/news/page.tsx`
  - **Component**: NewsCard props assignment
  - **Line**: 396
  - **Issue**: Accessing `article.featured_image` when only `article.thumbnail` exists

### Data Flow Analysis
1. NewsArticle data fetched from database
2. Data passed to NewsCard component
3. imageUrl prop attempts fallback: `thumbnail || featured_image || placeholder`
4. TypeScript fails at compile time due to undefined property

### Dependencies
- NewsArticle type definition
- NewsCard component
- Database schema (news table structure)

## Impact Analysis

### Direct Impact
- Build process fails completely
- Cannot deploy to production
- Admin panel news management unavailable

### Indirect Impact
- CI/CD pipeline blocked
- Development workflow disrupted
- Production updates halted

### Risk Assessment
High risk - prevents all deployments until resolved

## Solution Approach

### Fix Strategy
Remove the reference to non-existent `featured_image` property, use only `thumbnail`

### Alternative Solutions
1. Add `featured_image` to NewsArticle type (not recommended - unnecessary duplication)
2. Update database schema to include featured_image field (overkill for simple naming issue)

### Risks and Trade-offs
Minimal risk - simple property reference correction

## Implementation Plan

### Changes Required
1. **Change 1**: Fix property reference in NewsCard props
   - File: `src/app/admin/news/page.tsx`
   - Modification: Remove `article.featured_image` from line 396

### Testing Strategy
1. Run `npm run build` to verify TypeScript compilation
2. Test news admin panel functionality
3. Verify images display correctly

### Rollback Plan
Simple code revert if any issues arise (extremely unlikely)
