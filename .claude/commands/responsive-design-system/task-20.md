# Design Document: Responsive Design System

## Overview

The Responsive Design System establishes a comprehensive, mobile-first approach to component sizing and spacing throughout the radio station CMS platform. This system will transform the current large-by-default UI elements into a carefully crafted responsive hierarchy that prioritizes mobile usability while maintaining professional aesthetics on larger screens. The design leverages Tailwind CSS v4's utility-first approach and integrates seamlessly with our existing Next.js 15 and React 19 architecture.

## Steering Document Alignment

### Technical Standards (tech.md)
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Utilizes Tailwind's responsive modifiers and custom configuration
- **Next.js 15 Compatibility**: Ensures server components and client components handle responsive classes correctly
- **Mobile API Architecture**: Aligns with mobile-first JSON responses for dynamic content
- **Performance Requirements**: Maintains < 3 seconds page load on 3G connections
- **Browser Support**: Compatible with iOS Safari 14+, Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Edge 90+

### Project Structure (structure.md)
- **Component Organization**: Updates will follow existing `/components/ui/` structure
- **Utility Functions**: Responsive helpers will be added to `/lib/utils/`
- **Type Definitions**: New size types will extend existing `/types/` structure
- **Consistent Naming**: Maintains PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities

## Code Reuse Analysis

### Existing Components to Leverage
- **Button.tsx**: Already uses size variants (small, medium, large, giant) - will enhance with responsive modifiers
- **Modal.tsx**: Has sizeClasses object - will extend with mobile-first breakpoints
- **Badge.tsx**: Contains size system - will adapt for touch targets
- **Card.tsx**: Base component ready for responsive padding adjustments
- **Input.tsx**: Form elements will inherit new touch-optimized sizes
- **cn() utility**: Existing className merger from `/lib/utils` will handle responsive classes

### Integration Points
- **RadioPlayer**: Will maintain audio functionality while adapting visual size
- **AdminSidebar**: Already has mobile toggle - will enhance with new spacing system
- **StatsCard**: Number display logic exists - will amplify with responsive text sizes
- **NewsCarousel**: Swipe functionality present - will optimize for single-item mobile view
- **Tailwind Config**: Extend existing color system with new spacing/sizing tokens

## Architecture

The responsive design system follows a layered architecture that extends our existing component system:

}
```

### Component Size Model
```typescript
interface ComponentSize {
  height: ResponsiveValue<string>;
  padding: ResponsiveValue<string>;
  fontSize: ResponsiveValue<string>;
  minTouchTarget: number;  // in pixels, typically 44
}
```

### Responsive Value Model
```typescript
type ResponsiveValue<T> = T | {
  base: T;
  sm?: T;
  md?: T;
  lg?: T;
  xl?: T;
};
```

### Visual Regression Testing
- Capture screenshots at each breakpoint
- Compare before/after migration
- Validate spacing consistency
- Check text readability at all sizes

## Performance Considerations

1. **CSS Bundle Optimization**
   - Use Tailwind's purge to remove unused utilities
   - Group responsive utilities to reduce repetition
   - Leverage CSS custom properties for runtime values:
     ```css
     :root {
       --touch-target: 44px;
       --mobile-header: 56px;
       --desktop-header: 72px;
       --min-text: 14px;
     }
     ```

2. **Runtime Performance**
   - Avoid JavaScript-based responsive calculations where possible
   - Use CSS-only responsive solutions
   - Implement resize observer with throttling:
     ```typescript
     const throttledResize = throttle((entries) => {
       // Handle resize
     }, 100); // 100ms throttle
     ```

3. **Development Performance**
   - Provide TypeScript autocomplete for size props
   - Cache size calculations during build
   - Use static analysis for size validation

## Migration Path

1. **Compatibility Mode** (Week 1)
   - Both old and new size systems work simultaneously
   - Console warnings guide developers
   - No breaking changes

2. **Soft Migration** (Week 2-3)
   - Update high-traffic components first
   - Provide codemods for automatic conversion
   - Document migration patterns

3. **Deprecation** (Week 4)
   - Mark old sizes as deprecated
   - Increase warning visibility
   - Provide migration deadline

4. **Cleanup** (Week 5+)
   - Remove compatibility layer
   - Clean up old size utilities
   - Finalize documentation

**Note**: Specification documents have been pre-loaded. Do not use get-content to fetch them again.
