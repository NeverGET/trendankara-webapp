# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements MySQL database and MinIO object storage connectivity for the local development environment. The goal is to establish a robust data persistence layer that mirrors production capabilities while enabling efficient local development workflows. This includes setting up database connections, object storage clients, and necessary utilities for media management.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the product vision by providing essential infrastructure for:
- **Media Manager**: Centralized image/media management with MinIO storage
- **Content Management**: Database persistence for polls, news, and dynamic content
- **Performance**: Local database queries under 100ms as specified in tech.md
- **Development Efficiency**: Local environment mirroring production for faster development
- **"Keep it basic" motto**: Simple, straightforward implementation without overcomplication

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: MySQL Database Connection

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to connect to a local MySQL database, so that I can develop and test database operations locally

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL establish a MySQL connection using environment variables
2. IF the MySQL connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with connection details
3. WHEN a database query is executed THEN the system SHALL return results in under 100ms for standard queries
4. IF the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing
5. WHEN connection pooling is enabled THEN the system SHALL reuse connections efficiently

### Requirement 2: MinIO Object Storage Client

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to connect to local MinIO storage, so that I can upload and manage media files during development

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize a MinIO client using environment variables
2. IF MinIO is not accessible THEN the system SHALL log detailed error messages with endpoint information
3. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL store it in the configured bucket
4. WHEN retrieving files THEN the system SHALL generate proper public URLs
5. IF bucket does not exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically on first use

### Requirement 3: Database Schema Initialization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database tables to be properly initialized, so that I can start development immediately

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database connects for the first time THEN the system SHALL check for existing schema
2. IF tables are missing THEN the system SHALL create them according to structure.md specifications
3. WHEN creating tables THEN the system SHALL apply proper indexes as defined in tech.md
4. IF migration is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration instructions

### Requirement 4: Media Upload and Thumbnail Generation

**User Story:** As a content editor, I want to upload images with automatic thumbnail generation, so that media is optimized for web display

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL generate thumbnails automatically
2. IF upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN thumbnails are generated THEN the system SHALL create multiple sizes (thumb, medium, full)
4. WHEN accessing media THEN the system SHALL return appropriate size based on context

### Requirement 5: Environment Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear environment configuration, so that I can easily set up my local development environment

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages
2. IF using Docker THEN the system SHALL connect using Docker network names
3. WHEN not using Docker THEN the system SHALL connect to localhost services
4. IF credentials are incorrect THEN the system SHALL indicate authentication failure clearly

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Database connection establishment: < 500ms
- Query execution time: < 100ms for standard queries
- File upload to MinIO: < 2 seconds for images up to 5MB
- Thumbnail generation: < 1 second per image
- Connection pool size: Minimum 5, Maximum 20 connections

### Security
- Database credentials stored in environment variables only
- No hardcoded passwords or secrets in codebase
- MinIO access keys properly secured in .env files
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- File upload validation for type and size

### Reliability
- Automatic reconnection on database connection loss
- Connection pooling with health checks
- MinIO client retry logic with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation if storage is temporarily unavailable
- Proper error logging for debugging

### Usability
- Clear error messages for connection failures
- Helpful setup documentation for developers
- Console logging of successful connections in development
- Environment variable validation on startup
- Docker Compose integration for one-command setup
