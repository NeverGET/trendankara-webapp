# ReUI Migration Requirements

## Feature Overview
Complete UI overhaul of the TrendAnkara web application by migrating from custom-built UI components to ReUI, a modern React UI library built with Tailwind CSS. This migration encompasses both the public-facing website and the administrative panel.

## User Stories

### 1. As a Radio Listener
**I want** a modern, visually appealing interface with consistent components
**So that** I can enjoy a better user experience while listening to the radio and browsing content
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN I visit the website, THEN I see a professional dark-themed interface using RED/BLACK/WHITE colors
- WHEN I interact with any UI element, THEN the response is smooth and consistent
- WHEN I navigate between pages, THEN the UI components maintain consistent styling
- WHEN I view the site on different devices, THEN the interface remains responsive and usable

### 2. As a Station Administrator
**I want** an intuitive and consistent admin interface
**So that** I can efficiently manage content without UI-related confusion or inconsistencies
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN I access the admin panel, THEN I see a cohesive dark-themed interface
- WHEN I use form inputs, THEN they provide clear visual feedback
- WHEN I view tables and lists, THEN they are properly styled and readable
- WHEN I use modals and dialogs, THEN they follow consistent design patterns

### 3. As a Developer
**I want** standardized UI components from a maintained library
**So that** I can develop features faster and maintain the codebase more efficiently
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN I need to add a new UI element, THEN I can use ReUI components
- WHEN I update components, THEN the changes are consistent across the application
- WHEN I need to customize styles, THEN I can use ReUI's theming system
- WHEN I implement new features, THEN I have access to comprehensive component documentation

### 4. As a Mobile App Developer
**I want** the web API to remain unchanged
**So that** the mobile app continues to function without modifications
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN the mobile app makes API calls, THEN all endpoints remain unchanged
- WHEN the app receives API responses, THEN the data structure remains the same
- WHEN users interact with polls/news via mobile, THEN the backend processing is unaffected

   - Maintain existing prop interfaces where possible

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Page load time must not increase by more than 10%

## Migration Strategy Constraints
1. **Incremental Migration**
   - Components can be migrated one at a time

   - Git branch strategy for safe migration
   - Feature flags for gradual rollout

## Success Criteria
