# Requirements Document: Responsive Design System

## Introduction

This feature establishes a comprehensive, mobile-first responsive design system for the radio station CMS platform. The system will standardize component sizing across all interfaces (public website, admin panel, and mobile app) to ensure optimal usability on small screens while maintaining professional aesthetics on larger displays. The design system will prioritize content legibility and touch-friendly interactions, with special focus on making statistical numbers prominent while reducing overall UI element sizes.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the product's core motto "Keep it basic, don't overcomplicate anything" by:
- **Simplifying visual hierarchy** through consistent sizing rules
- **Improving mobile accessibility** for Turkish radio listeners accessing content on phones
- **Enhancing admin efficiency** by optimizing dashboard layouts for various screen sizes
- **Supporting mobile app integration** through consistent design tokens
- **Maintaining professional aesthetics** while improving usability

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Mobile-First Typography Scale

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want text to be readable without zooming, so that I can comfortably consume content on my phone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying on touch devices THEN interactive elements SHALL have minimum 44x44px touch targets
2. IF space is constrained THEN the system SHALL use 40x40px with increased spacing between elements
3. WHEN elements are grouped THEN the system SHALL provide minimum 8px gap between touch targets
4. IF an element has an icon only THEN the system SHALL ensure the clickable area meets minimum size requirements
5. WHEN hover states are shown THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback without layout shift

### Requirement 3: Responsive Admin Dashboard Components

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the dashboard to be usable on tablets and phones, so that I can manage content from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing dashboard on mobile THEN cards SHALL stack vertically in single column
2. IF viewing on tablet (640-1024px) THEN the system SHALL display 2-column grid layout
3. WHEN statistics are displayed THEN numbers SHALL use maximum available space while labels remain compact
4. IF sidebar is present on mobile THEN it SHALL collapse to hamburger menu with overlay
5. WHEN tables are displayed on mobile THEN they SHALL be horizontally scrollable with sticky first column

### Requirement 4: Consistent Spacing System

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent spacing throughout the interface, so that the layout feels cohesive and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying padding to containers THEN the system SHALL use 8px base unit scale (8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48)
2. IF on mobile devices THEN padding SHALL reduce by one step (e.g., desktop 24px â†’ mobile 16px)
3. WHEN spacing between sections THEN the system SHALL maintain visual hierarchy with proportional gaps
4. IF elements are related THEN spacing SHALL be tighter (8-16px) than between unrelated elements (24-40px)
5. WHEN cards or containers are nested THEN inner padding SHALL be smaller than outer padding

### Requirement 5: Navigation and Header Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the navigation to be accessible without taking too much screen space, so that content remains the focus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN header height SHALL not exceed 56px
2. IF on desktop THEN navigation height SHALL be maximum 72px with comfortable click targets
3. WHEN logo is displayed THEN it SHALL scale responsively while maintaining aspect ratio
4. IF navigation has many items THEN mobile SHALL use collapsible menu or horizontal scroll
5. WHEN admin sidebar is shown on desktop THEN width SHALL be maximum 240px

### Requirement 6: Responsive Media and Content Cards

**User Story:** As a user, I want media content to display properly on my device, so that I can view images and cards without distortion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying news cards on mobile THEN they SHALL use full width with 16px horizontal padding
2. IF images are shown THEN they SHALL maintain aspect ratio with responsive sizing
3. WHEN poll cards are displayed THEN voting buttons SHALL be prominently sized for easy interaction
4. IF carousel is used THEN mobile SHALL show single item with swipe navigation
5. WHEN modal overlays appear THEN they SHALL leave minimum 16px margin on mobile screens

### Requirement 7: Data Visualization and Statistics

**User Story:** As a user viewing statistics, I want numbers to be prominent and easy to read, so that I can quickly understand the data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying primary statistics THEN numbers SHALL use 2xl-4xl size (32-48px) on mobile
2. IF showing secondary metrics THEN the system SHALL use proportionally smaller but still prominent sizes
3. WHEN labels accompany numbers THEN they SHALL use uppercase text-xs (12px) for contrast
4. IF trends or changes are shown THEN indicators SHALL be clearly visible with color coding
5. WHEN multiple stats are grouped THEN the system SHALL maintain clear visual separation

### Requirement 8: Form and Input Optimization

**User Story:** As a user filling forms, I want inputs to be appropriately sized for my device, so that data entry is comfortable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying form inputs on mobile THEN height SHALL be minimum 44px for comfortable typing
2. IF on desktop THEN inputs SHALL be 40-48px height with appropriate font size
3. WHEN labels are shown THEN they SHALL be clearly associated with inputs using proper spacing
4. IF validation messages appear THEN text SHALL be minimum 14px with clear color indication
5. WHEN forms have multiple fields THEN mobile SHALL use single column layout with adequate spacing

### Requirement 9: Integration with Existing Component System
