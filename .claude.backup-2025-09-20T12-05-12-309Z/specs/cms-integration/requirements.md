# Requirements Document - CMS Integration

## Introduction

This specification defines the integration of the admin panel and public components to create a complete Content Management System (CMS) for the Turkish radio station platform. The system will connect existing admin features with the public-facing site, add confirmation dialogs for critical actions, and make radio stream configuration dynamic through the database rather than static configuration.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the product motto "Keep it basic, don't overcomplicate anything" by:
- Providing a simple yet effective CMS for content management
- Enabling station administrators to manage radio settings without technical knowledge
- Enhancing admin efficiency through confirmation dialogs preventing accidental actions
- Creating a seamless connection between admin operations and public content delivery

The integration aligns with key business objectives:
- **Admin efficiency**: Streamlined content management with safety mechanisms
- **Stream stability**: Dynamic configuration without code changes
- **Professional presence**: Consistent content flow from admin to public site

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Confirmation Dialogs for Critical Actions

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want confirmation dialogs for delete, publish, and other critical actions, so that I can avoid accidental data loss or unintended changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin clicks delete on any content (news, poll, media) THEN system SHALL display a confirmation modal with clear warning message
2. IF admin confirms deletion THEN system SHALL proceed with delete operation AND show success notification
3. IF admin cancels deletion THEN system SHALL close modal AND retain the original content unchanged
4. WHEN admin clicks publish/unpublish THEN system SHALL display confirmation with content preview
5. WHEN batch operations are performed THEN system SHALL show count of affected items in confirmation
6. IF delete operation fails THEN system SHALL display error message AND keep content intact

### Requirement 2: Dynamic Radio Stream Configuration

**User Story:** As a station administrator, I want to manage radio stream URLs through the admin panel, so that I can update stream settings without requiring developer intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin accesses radio settings page THEN system SHALL display current stream configuration from database
2. IF stream URL is updated THEN system SHALL validate URL format before saving
3. WHEN test button is clicked THEN system SHALL attempt connection to stream AND display status (success/failure)
4. WHEN settings are saved THEN system SHALL update database AND reload radio player with new configuration
5. IF stream URL is invalid THEN system SHALL display error message AND retain previous working configuration
6. WHEN metadata URL is updated THEN system SHALL validate AND test metadata endpoint

### Requirement 3: Admin-Public Content Integration

**User Story:** As a content editor, I want my admin panel changes to immediately reflect on the public site, so that content management is efficient and transparent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN news is published in admin THEN it SHALL appear on public homepage within 5 seconds
2. IF poll is activated in admin THEN it SHALL be available for voting on public site immediately
3. WHEN featured content is set in admin THEN homepage SHALL prioritize display accordingly
4. IF content is unpublished THEN it SHALL be removed from public view immediately
5. WHEN media is uploaded in admin THEN it SHALL be available for use in public content
6. IF cache exists THEN system SHALL invalidate relevant caches on content updates

### Requirement 4: Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper authentication for all admin operations, so that only authorized users can manage content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing admin routes without authentication THEN system SHALL redirect to login page
2. IF valid session token exists THEN system SHALL allow access to authorized admin features
3. WHEN session expires THEN system SHALL prompt for re-authentication
4. IF user role is insufficient THEN system SHALL display "Access Denied" message
5. WHEN API calls are made without auth token THEN system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized
6. IF authentication fails repeatedly THEN system SHALL enforce rate limiting

### Requirement 5: End-to-End Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for the CMS integration, so that all components work together reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL verify admin-to-public content flow
2. IF confirmation dialogs are triggered THEN tests SHALL verify both confirm and cancel paths
3. WHEN radio settings are updated THEN tests SHALL verify player reconnection with new URL
4. IF authentication is required THEN tests SHALL verify both authorized and unauthorized access
5. WHEN database changes occur THEN tests SHALL verify data integrity
6. IF errors occur THEN tests SHALL verify proper error handling and recovery

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Admin panel operations must complete within 2 seconds
- Public content updates must reflect within 5 seconds
- Radio stream configuration changes must apply within 10 seconds
- Modal animations must be smooth (60fps)

### Security
- All admin operations require valid NextAuth session
- Radio stream URLs must be validated before saving
- SQL injection prevention for all database operations
- XSS protection for all user inputs
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations

### Reliability
- System must handle stream URL changes without dropping active listeners
- Confirmation dialogs must prevent accidental data loss
- Database transactions for critical operations
- Graceful fallback if new stream URL fails

### Usability
- Confirmation messages in Turkish for user clarity
- Visual feedback for all actions (loading, success, error states)
- Mobile-responsive admin interface
- Keyboard navigation support for modals
- Clear error messages with suggested actions

### Compatibility
- Support for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile device support for admin panel
- iOS-specific optimizations for radio player
- Database compatibility with MySQL 8.0+

## Technical Constraints

- Must use existing NextAuth session mechanism
- Must integrate with current MySQL database schema
- Must maintain existing API response formats
- Must preserve current UI design system
- Must support Turkish language interface

## Success Metrics

- Zero accidental deletions after confirmation dialog implementation
- 90% reduction in support requests for stream URL changes
- Admin task completion time reduced by 30%
- 100% test coverage for critical paths
- Zero security vulnerabilities in authentication flow
