# Media Testing Summary

## Test Setup
Created comprehensive test suite for media functionality with the following components:

### 1. Test Images Downloaded
Successfully downloaded test images from Lorem Picsum in various resolutions:
- **Widescreen Full HD** (1920x1080) - 10 images
- **Vertical Full HD** (1080x1920) - 6+ images
- **720p Wide** (1280x720) - To be downloaded
- **720p Vertical** (720x1280) - To be downloaded
- **480p Vertical** (480x854) - To be downloaded
- **Full HD Square** (1080x1080) - To be downloaded

Total downloaded: 16+ test images in `temp-test-images/` directory

### 2. Media Endpoints Identified
Located media API endpoints at:
- `/api/media/` - Main media list endpoint (GET)
- `/api/media/upload/` - Upload endpoint (POST)
- `/api/media/{id}` - Individual media operations (GET/DELETE)

Note: These are public API endpoints, not admin-specific (`/api/admin/media/` doesn't exist)

### 3. Test Scripts Created
- `download-test-images.js` - Downloads various sized images from Lorem Picsum
- `test-media-endpoints.js` - Tests upload, list, and delete operations

## Test Results

### Current Issues
1. **Server Responsiveness**: The local development server appears to be hanging on API requests
2. **Endpoint Location**: Media endpoints are under `/api/media/` not `/api/admin/media/`
3. **Authentication**: Media endpoints may not require admin authentication (public API)

### Database Schema
The `media` table exists in the database with proper structure for storing:
- File metadata (filename, type, size, mime_type)
- URLs for original and thumbnail
- Upload information (uploaded_by, created_at)
- Soft delete support (deleted_at)

## Recommendations

### For Production Testing
1. **MinIO Integration**: Verify MinIO storage is properly configured and accessible
2. **File Upload Limits**: Check Next.js body size limits for large images
3. **Thumbnail Generation**: Confirm automatic thumbnail generation works
4. **Authentication**: Determine if media endpoints should require authentication

### Next Steps
1. Restart the development server to resolve hanging issues
2. Test media upload with smaller files first
3. Verify MinIO bucket exists and is accessible
4. Check for any missing dependencies or configuration

## Test Files
All test files are available in:
- Images: `/temp-test-images/` directory
- Scripts: `download-test-images.js`, `test-media-endpoints.js`

## Clean Up
To remove test files:
```bash
rm -rf temp-test-images/
rm download-test-images.js test-media-endpoints.js
```
